This is a GUI version of youtube-dl found here:https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/

This software is the result of my realization that most people (including me) are too stupid or just lazy to use the command-line tool 'youtube-dl'. So I decided to build a GUI for it with only the most bare-bone features (youtube-dl has a ton of features which are not available in my version - maybe they will soon be available :p).


**To download the executable**, go to **downloads** section under releases : https://github.com/rnand/Youtuble-downloader/releases
