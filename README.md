This software is the result of my realization that most people (including me) are too stupid or just lazy to use the command-line tool 'youtube-dl'. So I decided to build a GUI for it with only the most bare-bone features (youtube-dl has a ton of features which are not available in my version - maybe they will soon be available :p).

The ability to queue videos and the ability to download more than one video at a time will be coming soon. In the mean time, you can add all the videos that you want to a youtube playlist and then download them. Another feature that I wish to add in the future releases is the ability to schedule downloads(single videos and queues). Ability to download mp3 audio is also will be implemented soon.

**To download the executable**, go to **downloads** section under releases : https://github.com/rnand/Youtuble-downloader/releases

You need dot net framework 4 to run the application.

You also need ffmpeg for DASH videos. Get it here: https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html

**USAGE**

1. Copy youtube video url to clipboard

2. Open YouTube Downloader.exe

3. Select the necessary options

4. Click *Download*
