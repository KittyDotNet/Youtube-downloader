This is a GUI version of youtube-dl found here:https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/

This software is the result of my realization that most people (including me) are just too lazy to use the command-line tool ['youtube-dl'](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/). So I decided to build a GUI for it with only the most bare-bone features (youtube-dl has a ton of features which are not available in my version - maybe they will soon be available :p).

You can download videos from other video sharing sites as well. A huge set of sites are supported. To see the full list of supported sites [go here.](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html) The advanced options like quality etc. are only applicable to youtube at the moment; soon they will apply to other sites as well.

Here it is in action:

The ability to queue videos and the ability to download more than one video at a time will be coming soon. In the mean time, you can add all the videos that you want to a youtube playlist and then download them. Another feature that I wish to add in the future releases is the ability to schedule downloads(single videos and queues).
