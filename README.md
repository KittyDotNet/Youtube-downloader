This is a GUI version of youtube-dl found here:https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/


This software is the result of my realization that most people (including me) are too stupid or just lazy to use the command-line tool 'youtube-dl'. So I decided to build a GUI for it with only the most bare-bone features (youtube-dl has a ton of features which are not available in my version).



**To download the executable**, go to **downloads** section under releases : https://github.com/rnand/Youtuble-downloader/releases

You need .net framework 4 to run the application.

You probably also need ffmpeg for DASH videos. Get it here: https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html
